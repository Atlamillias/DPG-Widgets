**DPGWidgets** is an object-oriented wrap around the [DearPyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) graphical interface framework. The bulk of it is auto-generated by a script that parses the **DearPyGui** API and dumps what it finds to files as class objects, while the higher-level API is aimed at making things like application management, adding event handlers, and theming more pythonic.

Documentation, examples, etc will be added periodically. The source code has many comments and docstrings, and it is encouraged to read through them. MOST of the [DearPyGui documentation](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui/wiki) will also apply here.


## Example
```python
import dpgwidgets as dpgw
from dpgwidgets import containers
from dpgwidgets import widgets

app = dpgw.Viewport()
app.title = "ExampleApp"

with containers.Window("Window1") as window1:
    ...

@app.on_resize
def on_app_resize():
    widgets.Text(f"{app.title} resized!", parent=window1)

@window1.on_resize
def on_window1_resize():
    widgets.Text(f"{window1.label} resized!", parent=window1)

app.start()
```
